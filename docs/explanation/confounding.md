# Confounding and Sensitivity

If actions are influenced by unobserved factors that also affect rewards,
standard OPE can be biased.

## What to do

- Run sensitivity analysis to obtain partial-identification bounds.
- Use proximal OPE when you have valid proxy variables.
- Report assumptions explicitly in analyses.
