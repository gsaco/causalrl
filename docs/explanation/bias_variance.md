# Bias-Variance Tradeoffs

IS-based estimators are unbiased but can have high variance. Model-based
estimators reduce variance but introduce model bias. DR methods aim to balance
both by combining model estimates with importance weights.

Key takeaways:

- Long horizons magnify variance in IS/PDIS.
- WDR and MAGIC can stabilize estimates when models are reasonable.
- FQE is attractive when propensities are unknown but model fit is reliable.
