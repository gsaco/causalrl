# Proximal OPE (Advanced)

This tutorial demonstrates a confounded bandit where standard OPE is biased and
proximal estimation uses proxy variables to improve robustness.

Use `ProximalPolicyValueEstimand` and `ProximalOPEEstimator` to make proximal
assumptions explicit and inspect bridge diagnostics.
