# Project Status

## Current scope

- Unconfounded OPE with explicit estimands, diagnostics, and synthetic benchmarks
- Bandit propensity sensitivity analysis under bounded confounding assumptions
- Baseline estimators for IS, WIS, PDIS, DR, and FQE

## Experimental and non-goals

- Confounded and transport settings are exposed as experimental interfaces only
- Representation learning claims are treated as heuristics unless identified

## Roadmap

- Transport and mechanism shift tooling
- Expanded confounded MDP benchmarks and sensitivity analyses
- Additional diagnostics for model misspecification
