# Diagnostics

Diagnostics are the evidence you present alongside any policy value estimate.
They answer: should you trust this number?

## What diagnostics measure

- **Overlap**: support violations or near-zero behavior probabilities.
- **ESS**: how much effective data remains after weighting.
- **Weight tails**: risk of estimates dominated by a few samples.

## How to read them

- Overlap violations mean identification is broken.
- Low ESS signals high variance and fragile estimates.
- Heavy tails mean that even unbiased estimators can be unstable.
