# causalrl

causalrl is an estimand-first toolkit for causal reinforcement learning and
offline policy evaluation. The API emphasizes identification assumptions,
automatic diagnostics, and benchmark-driven development.

## Highlights

- Explicit estimands and assumption sets for each estimator
- Diagnostics-first reports with overlap and ESS metrics
- Synthetic benchmarks with known ground truth
- Minimal dependencies with a PyTorch backend for model-based baselines

## Quickstart

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

See the tutorials for minimal scripts and benchmark runs.
