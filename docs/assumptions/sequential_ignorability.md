# Sequential Ignorability

**Assumption**
- No unmeasured confounding given observed history.

**Applies to**
- IS, WIS, PDIS, DR, FQE.

**Definition**
- Conditional on observed history, the action at each time step is independent
  of potential outcomes under alternative actions.

**Diagnostics**
- Not directly testable; use domain knowledge and falsification tests.

**Failure modes**
- Hidden confounding yields biased OPE estimates.

- Hernan and Robins, Causal Inference: What If.
